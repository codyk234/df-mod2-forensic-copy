# df-mod2-forensic-copy
I started by creating 5 .txt files for the project. I then ran SHA256 hash values for each evidence file. I did this in Powershell through VS Code.

The results were as follows:

doc1/hash1: 17A8FDB3DECE9020B500F7DE85A7854EA1DE48CB83257B99B404C222EB8ED736

doc2/hash2: 84ECB6D3464D1C3D8178665AF34748EB63D19AABC5B52C9E41A362879B8826AE

doc3/hash3: 900E638F5DC9FD5FB16BF18263F06241106C588E9275AF576BDF1771A4E470A4

doc4/hash4: 2E5E134A269931ECA88DC309A03639E6E8BD09AF831A356CDA94F5F631131C8B

doc5/hash5: 55319AA5D5A5BCFA404CD152A1DE44AE5C1742C7A50CFD89FD03DF832CCA50BD

I then used Powershell in VS Code to make copies of the of each of the evidence files. I used Powershell in VS Code to run SHA256 has values for each copy to confirm it was a perfect copy.

The results of the copy's hashes were as follows:

doc1/hash1-copy:
